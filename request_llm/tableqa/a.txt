Cellularization of the syncytial endosperm is initiated in the micropylar endosperm of Arabidopsis after the globular embryo stage[11]. After cellularization, endosperm cells undergo a small number of synchronous cell division depending on their position along the micropylar-chalazal axis[12]. The central portion of the peripheral endosperm undergoes cell division until the central cell cavity is completely filled with cells[12]. The endosperm then begins to break down gradually, and the reserves support early embryo development[13]. Finally, only a single peripheral endosperm cell layer, referred to as the aleurone layer, is present in the mature seed[13] (Fig. 1a). The rate of division of the cellularized endosperm is much slower than that of syncytial endosperm nuclei[1,14]. The seed almost reaches the final size at the late globular stage of embryo development[2]. Coincidence in the timing of endosperm cellularization with the end of the main stage of seed growth indicates that proliferation of the syncytial endosperm and the timing of endosperm cellularization play crucial roles in determining the sizes of the endosperm and seed in Arabidopsis and many other dicot plants[12] (Fig. 1a). The endosperm of monocot plants, such as maize and rice, occupies the most volume in the mature seed (Fig. 1b). After growth of the ephemeral syncytial endosperm, the endosperm undergoes rapid cellularization and differentiation. During this time, the cellularized endosperm also undergoes a small series of cell proliferation. Then, endoreduplication and cell expansion occur in the central part of the endosperm. Finally, the endosperm cells undergo programmed cell death (PCD) and desiccation (Fig. 1b). During the first 10 days after pollination (DAP), the proliferation of syncytial endosperm nuclei and the endosperm cell division to form the majority of the endosperm cells, which determines kernel sink strength, storage capacity, and kernel size[1,15,16] (Fig. 1b). Therefore, early endosperm growth plays a fundamental role in determining seed size in higher plants. Here, we focus on the recent advances in the regulation of early endosperm growth and discuss the possible molecular mechanisms by which early endosperm development controls seed size (Fig. 2; Table 1).\n        **table title**\n        Table 1.

The elevated cytokinin levels during early endosperm development enhance storage capacity and kernel size, making ZmIPT2 crucial for controlling yield-related traits in Maize.\n        \n    ## example2\n    ### related table info\n        **article title**\n        Spatial Differentiation Characteristics of Human Settlements and Their Responses to Natural and Socioeconomic Conditions in the Marginal Zone of an Uninhabited Area, Changtang Plateau, China\n        **table in section**\n        Socioeconomic factors\n        **table in context**\n        Traffic conditions and the distance from the administrative center affect the exchange of material, energy, and information between rural settlements and the outside world, directly affecting production efficiency and quality of life for residents. This study analyzes the buffer zone of township roads and highways at 2 km intervals and township centers at 3 km intervals, and calculates the areas of settlements within different distances (Table 2). The proportion of settlement areas within 2 km of roads comprises 56.26% of the total settlement area, and as this distance increases the proportion gradually decreases. In addition, 9.84% of the total settlement area is distributed in the area 14 km away from roads. With socioeconomic improvements, human activity on the CTP has gradually broken away from the traditional lifestyle of ‘self-sufficiency’ and has increased the demand for external connections. This means that the layout of human settlements shows an obvious traffic-location orientation. However, because animal husbandry still uses the method of ‘raising animals by nature’, grazing activity is highly dependent on natural pastures, so a certain proportion of human settlements are still located in areas far away from major transportation routes but with relatively good water and grass conditions. With respect to distance from an administrative center, the settlement area within 3 km of a center accounts for only 34.94% of the total, with 48.24% of the total settlement area located more than 15 km from a town center. With the environmental conditions, vast area, and sparse population on the CTP, the functions of highland townships are relatively simple—mainly comprising administrative management, with limited economic functions. Human production activity on the CTP consists mainly of animal husbandry, and the level of non-agriculture activity is low. The effects of economic radiation from administrative centers to surrounding settlements are unclear, and the agglomeration of settlements in township centers is not yet pronounced on the CTP, where economic development is relatively poor.\n        **table title**\n        Table 2.
